                        At approximately 9:30am in the Dorfman Theatre last week, a big and exciting announcement was made by Mr Troen, head of Entrepreneurship at our school. It was potentially our turn to be involved in Young Enterprise.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        And so, 15 minutes later a group of 5 was formed. 2 more joined later to become 7. We were told that we had to pitch an idea to the judges on the 18th of September in Dragons Den Style.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        The year group was all hyped in excitement, however getting through the first hurdle will not be easy. Indeed, only 3 teams will be given a place. Every break time between then and now did our group meet up. 
                        We discussed weird and wacky ideas. Suggestions included automatic recycling bin sorters, phone holders that stuck to your chest, and eye tracking devices that allowed hands-free navigation on your smartphone.
                        
                        But theres something that we know for sure.
                        We want to solve a problem. Whether that environmental issues, educational issues, cost issues or skill issues, we want to use Young Enterprise as an opportunity to help society in one way or another.
